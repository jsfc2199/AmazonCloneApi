        'It seems like DDR4 has ruled the roost forever. Finally, new motherboards and architectures have allowed memory to grow wings with the advent of DDR5. Improved clock speeds promise up to twice the bandwidth of DDR4, all with lower voltage for better efficiency. To further help with that last bit, DDR5 has on-board power management to reduce motherboard cost and complexity.\n\nReliability has also been improved by the introduction of on-die error-correction technology. Memory availability is improved by splitting the internal 64-bit (72-bit with ECC) channel into two independent, 32-bit channels (40-bit with ECC) and the addition of same bank refresh. Combined with other features, including those that allow for up to four times the module capacity with consumer DRAM, DDR5 ensures your multi-core CPU wont be memory-starved.\n\nOur DDR5 comes in both U-DIMM and SO-DIMM form factors to help you out, whether youre using a desktop, laptop, or other embedded device. We meet JEDEC standards to ensure compatibility and reliability. We offer a wide range of capacities at an affordable price to make upgrading an easy choice - even the installation process is easy. So, what are you waiting for? Its time for the newest technology to grace your machine.\nPackage contents:\n\nSABRENT DDR5 SO-DIMM Memory Kit.\nUser manual.',

        "WINDFORCE 3X COOLING SYSTEM The WINDFORCE 3X cooling system features three 80mm unique blade fans, alternate spinning, 5 composite copper heat pipes directly touch the GPU, 3D active fan and Screen cooling, which together provide high efficiency heat dissipation. ALTERNATE SPINNING Alternate Spinning can reduce the turbulence of adjacent fans and increase air pressure. SMOOTH AIRFLOW GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure. 3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. UNIQUE BLADE FAN The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface. GRAPHENE NANO LUBRICANT Graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of sleeve bearing fan by 2.1 times, close to the life of double ball bearing, and is quieter. SCREEN COOLING Extended heatsink design allows air flow to pass through, providing better heat dissipation. HEAT PIPES DIRECT TOUCH The shape of the pure copper heat pipe maximizes the direct contact area with the GPU. RGB FUSION 2.0 With 16.7M customizable color options and numerous lighting effects, you can choose lighting effects or synchronize with other AORUS devices. PROTECTION METAL BACK PLATE The metal back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection. POWER INDICATOR When experiencing any power supply abnormality, the indicator will alert gamers by flashing light. EXTREME DURABILITY AND OVERCLOCKING The graphics card uses the better power phase design to allow the MOSFET to operate at lower temperature, and over-temperature protection design and load balancing for each MOSFET, plus the Ultra Durable certified chokes and capacitors, to provide excellent performance and longer system life. FRIENDLY PCB DESIGN Fully automated production process ensures top quality of the circuit boards and eliminates sharp protrusions of the solder connectors seen on the conventional PCB surface. This friendly design prevents your hands from getting cut or inadvertently damaging components when making your build. AORUS ENGINE The cutting edge intuitive interface allows you to adjust the clock speed, voltage, fan performance and power target in real-time according to your game's requirements.",

        "The fast, easy way to improve your laptop's performance There's an easy cure for a slow computer: more memory. Designed to help your system run faster and smoother, Crucial Laptop Memory is one of the easiest and most affordable ways to improve your system's performance. Load programs faster. Increase responsiveness. Run data-intensive applications with ease, and increase your laptop's multitasking capabilities. Make everything on your computer faster Memory is a component in your computer that allows for short-term data access. Since your system's moment-to-moment operations rely on short-term data access - loading applications, browsing the Web or editing a spreadsheet - the speed and amount of memory in your system plays a critical role. Load apps in seconds by increasing the speed of your memory and installing more of it.  Multitask with ease If you're like us, you use your computer to do a lot of things at once. You might be editing a document, while also looking at pictures and browsing the internet. This naturally leads to a performance problem: every app you're running requires memory and competes for a limited pool of resources. Overcome this by installing high-density modules in each memory slot for seamless multitasking.  Install with ease - no computer skills required With just a screwdriver, your owner's manual, and a few minutes of time, you can install memory - no computer skills necessary. Just watch one of our three-minute install videos, and we'll walk you step-by-step through the process. Don't pay a computer shop to do something you can do in minutes! Maximize the value of your system At a fraction of the cost of a new system, a memory upgrade is one of the most affordable ways to increase performance. Get more out of your laptop by giving it the resources it needs to perform. Micron quality - a higher level of reliability. As a brand of Micron, one of the largest memory manufacturers in the world, Crucial Desktop Memory is the standard for reliable performance. From the original SDRAM technology all the way to DDR4, we've engineered the memory technologies that have powered the world's computers for 40 years and counting. When you choose Crucial memory, you're choosing memory that's backed by a limited lifetime warranty and designed for the world's leading systems. Don't settle for anything less.",
